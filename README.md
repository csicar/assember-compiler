assember-compiler
=================

an assembler to opcode compiler for minecraftmonkey 16bit cpu

#usage
*write the assember code down on the right side.
*the output will turn into a repesentation of the input busses that you already know (color sceme etc.)

#contribute

##Implement all functions
I haven't inplemented all operations for assembler commands yet (ALU is missing entirely)

##Extend the data-formats to export to
To date the assembler get only exported to HTML. Having JSON or even scematics, that you can easily integrate into the ROM would make the tool easier to use.

##Maybe adding a C to assembler compiler at some time ?
